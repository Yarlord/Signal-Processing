# Signal-Processing
MATLAB code. Involves encoding, modulating, demodulating, decoding of given input (could be images, text, random characters, or audio). Also involves plotting the BER curve, PSD, Time Domain plotting, and Constellatoin diagram depending on the type of signal.
SNR can be changed to get different BER curves.
