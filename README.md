# Signal-Processing
MATLAB code. Involves encoding, modulating, demodulating, decoding of given input (could be images, text, random characters, or audio). Also involves plotting the BER (bit error rate) curve, PSD (power spectral density), Time Domain plotting, and Constellatoin diagram depending on the type of signal.

SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) can be changed to get different BER curves.
